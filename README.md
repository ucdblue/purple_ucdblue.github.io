# BLUE @ UC Davis

This is the official website for the upcoming mobile and web app BLU. 
At the moment, its main purpose is to serve as a means for customer analytics. That way, we will be able to adapt our model and goals based on the responses we get.

Current members of the team are Vera O'Riordan, Veronica Scott, Clayton Braga, and Brandon Schroeder.
